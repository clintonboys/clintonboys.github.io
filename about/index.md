Welcome to the personal website of Clinton Boys. I am a 26-year old Australian, just completed my PhD in Pure Mathematics and teaching myself how to be a Data Scientist. This website contains my blog, as well as a partial (and growing) collection of projects of mine.

I am very interested in the crossover between mathematics, data and the social sciences, with a keen interest in elections and forecasting, as well as using data to solve and explore social problems.
