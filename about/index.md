I am an Australian mathematician, data scientist and software engineer living and working in London (formerly Tel Aviv). You can visit my [now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link now/index.md %}) page to see what I'm up to and what's on my mind at the moment. 

I graduated from the University of Sydney in 2011 with a First Class Honours degree in Pure Mathematics, and then in 2015 with a PhD in Mathematics. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions about my PhD [here]({% post_url 2015-01-19-phd-faq %}).

In 2015 I moved from Sydney to Tel Aviv and worked there for eight years at various startups, before ending up at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com). In 2023 I relocated with Via to London with my family. 

After my move to working in technology, I started out calling myself a data scientist, but in my nine years' experience I have become more and more of an all-rounder, incorporating software engineering, algorithm development and a lot of other tools into my toolkit. If you're interested in more details, you can find my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link clinton_boys_cv.pdf %}). My [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link posts/index.md %}) also contains a long history of posts about things I have been interested in over the years. 

If you'd like to know more about the tools I use to get things done, you can find my answers to the [usesthis](http://usesthis.com) questionnaire [here]({% post_url 2021-03-23-uses-this %}). You can also explore my [digital garden](http://mtsolitary.com).
