Welcome to the personal website of Clinton Boys. I am a 26-year old Australian, just completed my PhD in Pure Mathematics and teaching myself how to be a Data Scientist. This website contains my blog, as well as a partial (and growing) collection of projects of mine.

I am very interested in the crossover between mathematics, data and the social sciences, with a keen interest in elections and forecasting, as well as using data to solve and explore social problems.

The photographs across this website were all taken by me during my various travels. The website itself is served off [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme by Michael Rose.
