I am an Australian mathematician, data scientist and engineer living and working in Tel Aviv. If this is your first time visiting my site, you might want to start with my [now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link now/index.md %}) page to see what I'm up to and what's on my mind at the moment. 

I graduated from the University of Sydney in 2011 with a First Class Honours degree in Pure Mathematics, and then in 2015 with a PhD in Mathematics. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions about my PhD [here]({% post_url 2015-01-19-phd-faq %}).

In 2015 I moved to Tel Aviv and have been working since then as a data scientist at various startups. Currently I'm working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com). In my five years' experience I have become more and more of a generalist, incorporating software engineering, algorithm development and a lot of other tools into my toolkit. If you're interested in more details, you can find my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link clinton_boys_cv.pdf %}).

My [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link posts/index.md %}) contains posts with five main themes:

- **Data and data science**. Some examples are [this]({% post_url 2017-01-15-bias-variance-tradeoff %}) post on the bias-variance tradeoff and [this]({% post_url 2015-03-30-itunes-and-pitchfork %}) small project where I do some analysis on my taste in music. 
- **Elections and modelling**. Some examples are the series of posts starting [here]({% post_url 2014-09-01-aus-election-model-1 %}) about the pitfalls and difficulties of coming up with a model for forecasting Australian elections, or [this]({% post_url 2019-12-21-uk-av-sim %}) post which simulates the 2019 UK election under the Australian system. 
- **Mathematics, statistics and computer science**. Some examples are [this]({% post_url 2019-01-27-weak-law %}) post on the weak law of large numbers from a geometric perspective, or [this]({% post_url 2018-05-28-deep-learning %}) discussion of a universality property of neural networks. 
- **emacs**. The best place to start is the first [post]({% post_url 2020-05-20-emacs-i %}) in my series on my emacs configuration. 
- **General hacking and programming**. Some examples are the most popular post on this site, about a [script]({% post_url 2017-02-11-google-trends-scraper-2 %}) I wrote that stitches together Google Trends data from different timescales, or [this]({% post_url 2015-07-02-lifetime-flight-simulator %}) tongue-in-cheek lifetime flight simulator. 

If you'd like to know more about the tools I use to get things done, you can find my answers to the [usesthis](http://usesthis.com) questionnaire [here]({% post_url 2021-03-23-uses-this %}). You can also explore my [digital garden](http://mtsolitary.com).
