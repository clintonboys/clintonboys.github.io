title: About
---

I am an Australian mathematician, data scientist and engineer living and working in Tel Aviv. If this is your first time visiting my site, you might want to start with my [now](http://www.clintonboys.com/now) page to see what I'm up to and what's on my mind at the moment. 

I graduated from the University of Sydney in 2011 with a First Class Honours degree in Pure Mathematics, and then in 2015 with a PhD in Mathematics. You can find answers to some frequently asked questions about my PhD [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/phd-faq/).

In 2015 I moved to Tel Aviv and have been working since then as a data scientist at various startups. Currently I'm working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com). In my five years' experience I have become more and more of a generalist, incorporating software engineering, algorithm development and a lot of other tools into my toolkit. If you're interested in more details, you can find my resume [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/clinton_boys_cv.pdf).



If you'd like to know more about the tools I use to get things done, you can find my answers to the [usesthis](http://usesthis.com) questionnaire [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/uses-this/). 

The website itself is served off [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme by Michael Rose with some small customisations, and the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) plugin for displaying LaTeX.
