This is the personal website of Clinton Boys. 

I am an Australian mathematician, data scientist and engineer living and working in Tel Aviv. 

If this is your first time visiting my site, you might want to start with my [about]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about/index.md %}) page for some more details about who I am and what I do, or my [now]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link now/index.md %}) page to see what I’m up to and what’s on my mind at the moment.

My [blog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link posts/index.md %}) contains posts about data science, mathematics, elections and modelling.
