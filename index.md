This is the personal website of Clinton Boys. 

I am an Australian mathematician, data scientist and engineer living and working in Tel Aviv. 

If this is your first time visiting my site, you might want to start with my [about](http://www.clintonboys.com/about) page for some more details about who I am and what I do; or my [now](http://www.clintonboys.com/now) page to see what I’m up to and what’s on my mind at the moment.

My [blog](http://www.clintonboys.com/posts/) contains posts about data science, mathematics, elections and modelling.
