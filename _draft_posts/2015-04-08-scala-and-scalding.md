I spent a few days this week learning about Scalding. This is Twitter's in-house MapReduce framework, written in Scala. Scala is a language I've had almost no experience with, so this was a great opportunity for me to get a feel for the basic syntax, as well as come up with a couple of interesting problems that can be solved quickly and easily with Scalding. I also haven't had any real experience with distributed computing and MapReduce as a paradigm, so this gave me the chance to try and understand that too (and to write up a post about to make sure I really do understand it).
