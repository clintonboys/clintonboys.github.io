## Data

- I wrote a [primitive scraper](https://github.com/clintonboys/gumtree_scraper) for trading post website gumtree.com using the Python packages Beautifu**lSoup and requests, which persistently searches the site for a given query and sends an email using Mandrill when there are new results (for example when you're after concert tickets). 
- I have been working on a [Kaggle competition](https://github.com/clintonboys/kaggle_fb_circles) for learning social circles from Facebook data and have written some basic models using the Python package networkx for thinking about the data and the problem.
- I've been working on the John Hopkins University Coursera Data Science specialization, which consists of nine courses in various aspects of data science (although I'm not working to their timetable or paying for the courses).
- I completed the Stanford University Algorithms Coursera course.
- It's an ongoing project of mine to develop a forecasting model for elections in Australia. I've made a number of posts on this website about the pitfalls and difficulties of coming up with such a model. 

## Mathematics

- My PhD thesis, submitted in 2014, was titled *Alternating quiver Hecke algebras*. It consisted of a careful and complete study of a new family of algebras, which generalise and build on important recent work. The main theorem of my thesis gives an explicit isomorphism between my new family of algebras and a family of classical objects which have been studied for over a century, providing new insight and structure for these objects. I'm in the process of submitting several papers to journals based on results in my thesis.
- I was involved in creating a series of [audio-visual learning modules](http://sydney.edu.au/stuserv/maths_learning_centre/2unit.shtml) for the University of Sydney's Mathematics Learning Centre to help HSC students quickly develop mathematics skills which are prerequisites for university courses.
- I ran the first-year linear algebra course MATH1002 for the University of Sydney Summer School in 2015. I took a much different approach to the course than in previous years, running the whole thing through a [Wordpress blog](http://ss1002.wordpress.com). I received a lot of very positive feedback from students on this experimental and forward-thinking course design.
