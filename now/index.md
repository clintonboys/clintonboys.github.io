### Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since August 2018. I'm leading a team of data scientists and algorithm engineers building tools to solve supply optimization problems.

### Digital garden

My [digital garden](https://mtsolitary.com) is growing slowly but surely and I'm really enjoying it, it has grown into something I'm quite proud of. 

### Haskell 

I started working on a Haskell implementation of the Lox language in Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book. This scratches two itches at once: learning Haskell, which is something I've always wanted to do but never really found time or an excuse for, and also building a much deeper understanding of how programming languages are built and function. 

### Life

- Spending lots of time drawing with my son.
- The weather is finally reasonable again here so we're spending a lot of time outside in the park.
- Working on my record collection.
