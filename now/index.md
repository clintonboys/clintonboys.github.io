This page contains a quick overview of what I'm doing right now. I try to update it every couple of months.

### Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since August 2018, doing all sorts of different stuff, algorithms, data science, and lately a lot more software engineering and web development. 

### Digital garden

Like I wrote last time, my [digital garden](https://mtsolitary.com) continues to grow into something I am proud of. 

### Bayesian statistics

I've been thinking about and reading about Bayesian methods a lot lately, it's a really elegant and nice way of looking at statistics that I always wanted to know more about. 

### Life

- We spent two months back in Australia over the southern hemisphere summer.
- I got the new 14" MacBook Pro, what a fantastically powerful machine. 
- I'm trying harder to be conscious of my time on devices: I am significantly reducing my time reading news and idly browsing, and instead doing something interesting, or doing something offline. 
- Maybe related to the above, I have developed an interest in birds, which I share with my son.
