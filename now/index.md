This page contains a quick overview of what I'm doing right now. I try to update it every couple of months.

### Relocation to London

I relocated to London in August this year with my wife and children. We are currently finding our feet in southeast London and have been very lucky with the weather so far. 

### Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since 2018, doing all sorts of different stuff, mostly related to algorithms and data science and then building interesting and useful products around these things. 

### Digital garden

Progress on my "digital garden", [Mt Solitary](https://mtsolitary.com) has been slow these last few months as I have been handling the relocation. When the pace of life is high, it's nice to have something like this to look at and remember that it has been slower in the past and will be slower again in the future.
