This page contains a quick overview of what I'm doing right now. I try to update it every couple of months.

### Work

I'm working for [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) and have been since August 2018. My official job title is Data Scientist, but in the past year or so I have drifted more into the world of discrete optimisation and operations research. I've always enjoyed developing new skills and learning stuff, and data and modelling is always at the heart of the work we're doing. 

### emacs, org-mode and org-roam

Lately I've fallen rather deeply down the rabbit-hole of configuring emacs and I'm spending more and more time using it as a tool for pretty much everything I do on a computer outside the browser. In particular, [org-roam](https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which extends the popular org-mode functionalities of emacs to something approximating the very buzzy Roam Research, has really changed the way I think about note-taking and writing. There's a whole community of interesting folks online who are into this nerdy combination of productivity, hacking, writing and self-improvement. 

### Other stuff

- My son Leo was born in February so much of my time at the moment is devoted to him. 
- I am reading on and off about quantum computing; in particular from [this](https://quantum.country/qcvc) source which has been very enjoyable. My goal here is to try and understand Shor's algorithm for quantum factorisation and why this has the theoretical capacity to upend RSA cryptography.
