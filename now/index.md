### Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since August 2018. I'm leading a team of data scientists and algorithm engineers building tools to solve supply planning problems.

### Digital garden

I have become very interested in the idea of digital gardens in the last year or so and have created my own [here](http://mtsolitary.com). It is supposed to be a much less polished place to share my notes and thoughts. There is a growing community online of people building these carefully tended online spaces and I find the idea inspiring. 

### Other stuff
