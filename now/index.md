This page contains a quick overview of what I'm doing right now. I try to update it every couple of months.

### Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since August 2018. I'm leading a team of data scientists and algorithm engineers building tools to solve supply planning problems.

### Digital garden

I have become very interested in the idea of [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) in the last year or so and have created my own [here](http://mtsolitary.com). It is supposed to be a much less polished place to share my notes and thoughts, a small public-facing slice of my much larger [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). 

There is a growing community online of people building these carefully tended online spaces and I find the idea inspiring. I've tied it in very nicely with my recent delve into the emacs / org-mode / org-roam rabbithole. 

### Life

- Watching in real time as a tiny human learns how to walk and speak. 
- Back riding my bike after a while and really enjoying it. 
- Got the new M1 MacBook Air. The most significant upgrade in using a computer since the first time I had an SSD drive. 

#### Books

- *Infinite Jest* by David Foster Wallace (doing my best on my second attempt). 

#### Music

- *Mwng* by Super Furry Animals.
- *Atlantic* by The Weather Report.
- *They Want My Soul* by Spoon.
