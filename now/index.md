### Work

I've been working at [Via](http://ridewithvia.com) since August 2018, doing all sorts of different stuff: algorithms, data science, and lately a lot more software engineering and web development, even some front-end stuff with React in Typescript. 

### Digital garden

Like I wrote last time, my [digital garden](https://mtsolitary.com) continues to grow into something I am proud of. 

### ECS and game development

As a bit of a distraction from my usual set of side projects focussed on data and elections that are documented on this site, I have been dipping my toe in the world of game development, specifically in Rust because I think it is a very interesting language to learn, and specifically using the Entity Component System paradigm, which is a neat way to reprogram one's object-oriented-brainwashed brain. 

### Life

- My daughter was born in June and we have been spending a lot of quiet time together at home. 
- We spent ten days in Nice, France over the late summer. A beautiful part of the world.
- Overall I am spending very little time hacking away at side projects lately, trying to take a bit more care of myself and take things slowly. Productivity is important and interesting but it can also be addictive and consuming and it's important to remember that living your life is enough.
