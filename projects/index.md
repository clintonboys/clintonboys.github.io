## Data

- It's an ongoing project of mine to develop a forecasting model for elections in Australia. I've made a number of posts on this website about the pitfalls and difficulties of coming up with such a model (starting [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/aus-election-model-1/)). I'm calling the model I'm building [Emma Chisit](http://www.clintonboys.com/emma-chisit/). 
- I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/clintonboys/gumtree_scraper" target="_blank">primitive scraper</a> for trading post website gumtree.com using the Python packages BeautifulSoup and requests, which persistently searches the site for a given query and sends an email using Mandrill when there are new results (for example when you're after concert tickets). 
- I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/clintonboys/trendy-scraper" target="_blank">trendy scraper</a> for Google trends which gives daily data for queries across long timescales (Google trends only outputs weekly data for periods longer than a few months).
- I wrote a very basic poll aggregator (starting [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/israel-poll-aggregator-1/)) for the 2015 Israeli elections; like all the polls it aggregated it turned out to be very wrong in the end.  
- There are some other posts on this website about data and data science:
  - [Here](http://www.clintonboys.com/itunes-and-pitchfork/) I quantify how much of a Pitchfork sychophant I am (not as much as I thought). 
  - [Here](http://www.clintonboys.com/repetition-index/) I code up a typical vague data science question from a job interview. 
  - Starting [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/qanda-tweets/) I do some sentiment analysis of Twitter data for tweets posted during the broadcast of an Australian political panel show infamous for its lively Twitter feed. 

## Mathematics

- My PhD thesis, submitted in 2014, was titled *Alternating quiver Hecke algebras*. It consisted of a careful and complete study of a new family of algebras, which generalise and build on important recent work. The main theorem of my thesis gives an explicit isomorphism between my new family of algebras and a family of classical objects which have been studied for over a century, providing new insight and structure for these objects. I'm in the process of submitting several papers to journals based on results in my thesis. I wrote a [FAQ](http://www.clintonboys.com/phd-faq/) about my PhD here. 
- I was involved in creating a series of <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/stuserv/maths_learning_centre/2unit.shtml" target="_blank">audio-visual learning modules</a> for the University of Sydney's Mathematics Learning Centre to help HSC students quickly develop mathematics skills which are prerequisites for university courses.
- I ran the first-year linear algebra course MATH1002 for the University of Sydney Summer School in 2015. I took a much different approach to the course than in previous years, running the whole thing through a <a href="http://ss1002.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress blog</a>. I received a lot of very positive feedback from students on this experimental and forward-thinking course design.

## Online courses

- I've been working on the John Hopkins University Coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1" target = "_blank">Data Science specialization</a>, which consists of nine courses in various aspects of data science (although I'm not working to their timetable or paying for the courses).
- I completed the Stanford University <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo" target="_blank">Algorithms Part 1</a> Coursera course and am currently working on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2" target = "_blank">Algorithms Part 2</a>.
- I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/clintonboys/kaggle_fb_circles" target = "_blank">Kaggle competition</a> for learning social circles from Facebook data and have written some basic models using the Python package networkx for thinking about the data and the problem.

## Other

- I'm a keen amateur (very) photographer: all over this website you can find examples of my photographs taken all over the world.
- I very much enjoy jogging, particularly in new and unexplored places.
- When I was twelve I wrote a novel about a motley crew of magical futuristic cat detectives. It was well-received by my mother: I'm still searching for a publisher.
