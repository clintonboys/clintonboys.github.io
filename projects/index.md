## Data

- It was an ongoing project of mine to develop a forecasting model for elections in Australia called [Emma Chisit](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195563160.001.0001/acref-9780195563160-e-1151). I made a number of posts on this website about the pitfalls and difficulties of coming up with such a model (starting [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/aus-election-model-1/)). I haven't found a lot of time for the project recently but hope to return to it someday. 
- I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/clintonboys/trendy-scraper" target="_blank">trendy scraper</a> for Google trends which gives daily data for queries across long timescales (Google trends only outputs weekly data for periods longer than a few months). See the post [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/google-trends-scraper-2/), or see the updated code in the <a href="https://github.com/clintonboys/trendy-scraper" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.
- My [blog](http://www.clintonboys.com/posts/) contains a bunch of posts about data and data science:
  - [Here](http://www.clintonboys.com/itunes-and-pitchfork/) I quantify how much of a Pitchfork sychophant I am (not as much as I thought). 
  - Starting [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/qanda-tweets/) I do some sentiment analysis of Twitter data for tweets posted during the broadcast of an Australian political panel show infamous for its lively Twitter feed. 
  - [Here](https://github.com/clintonboys/lifetime_flight_simulator) I wrote a tongue-in-cheek game to demonstrate the safety of air travel. 
  - [Here](http://www.clintonboys.com/kaggle-cc-fraud/) I play with an unbalanced Kaggle dataset on credit card fraud.
  - [Here](http://www.clintonboys.com/deep-learning/), [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/weak-law/) and [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/regression/) are some more mathematically-inclined posts about the theory behind some common machine learning / data science concepts. 

## Mathematics

- My [PhD thesis](http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/12725/2/2015_Clinton_Boys_Thesis.pdf), submitted in 2014, was titled *Alternating quiver Hecke algebras*. It consisted of a careful and complete study of a new family of algebras, which generalise and build on important recent work. The main theorem of my thesis gives an explicit [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism) between my new family of algebras and a family of classical objects which have been studied for over a century, providing new insight and structure for these objects. I wrote a [FAQ](http://www.clintonboys.com/phd-faq/) about my PhD here. 
- You can find a list of my published mathematics papers [here](https://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Boys_C/0/1/0/all/0/1). 
- I ran the first-year linear algebra course MATH1002 for the University of Sydney Summer School in 2015. I took a much different approach to the course than in previous years, running the whole thing through a Wordpress blog. 

## Other

- I'm a keen amateur (very) photographer: all over this website you can find examples of my photographs taken all over the world.
- [Here](https://github.com/clintonboys/call-your-mum) I made a simple Python application which reminds busy expats to call their mums.
- I very much enjoy jogging, particularly new places I haven't explored yet.
