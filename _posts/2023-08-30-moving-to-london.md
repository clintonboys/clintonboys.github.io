This is a quick post to announce that I have relocated with my family to London this August. After eight years in Tel Aviv we are looking for a new adventure, and London has always been one of our favourite cities in the world. 

My eight years working in Tel Aviv have taught me so much that I am not sure I would be able to write down a full list. I have had the opportunity to work with a whole bunch of very talented and smart people, many of whom I will continue to work with remotely after my relocation.
