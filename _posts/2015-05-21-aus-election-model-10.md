As I've recently (and finally) become gainfully employed, I haven't been able to devote a huge amount of time to my [model](http://www.clintonboys.com/emma-chisit/) for forecasting Australian elections. I have spent some time rewriting my sloppy code, fixing some redundancies and bugs, and improving the model to include the first few things on my [to-do list](http://www.clintonboys.com/aus-election-model-9/). 

The major theoretical improvement I've been thinking about over the last month is the [strong transition model](http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/strongmodel.html) which I learnt about while reading about the May 2015 UK general election (I was planning to write a post about why the polls failed so miserably to predict the result but I read so many good summaries of this I don't really think it's necessary).
