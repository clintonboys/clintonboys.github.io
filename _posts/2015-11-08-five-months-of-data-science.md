It's been more than five months since I started working as a data scientist. Since I taught myself most of the specific technical skills I needed, I thought I'd mention those things which I was happiest I'd already learned, and also those new skills I've picked up which I've found most valuable.

*Previous skills*

- Python. There is nothing like the power of Python (and particularly the pandas package) for quickly hacking together something you need. Is there some data transformation you find yourself doing fifteen times a day? Write a Python script. Need to augment your own data with some pulls from APIs? Use Python to both scrape and join the data. Python also has access to all standard machine learning algorithms with its scikit-learn package. 
- SQL. Like it or not SQL is still the heart of most data infrastructures. To obtain raw data sets for testing, or to provide basic reports and explanations for other people, SQL is the main way to access data. 
- Skepticism.
