I grew up in the 90s and 2000s, in what with hindsight can be seen as a fairly extraordinary period of global history. Compared to today, things were simpler, the overall trajectory seemed generally positive, the Internet offered the dream of a digital future of endless possibilities.

Today I can't help but feel we have squandered much of the opportunities for investing the growth and possibilities of those years, and things seem to have taken a turn for the worse, and even worse: I don't really see a path for them to get much better in the near term.
