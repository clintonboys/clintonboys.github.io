Here is a strategy for time-poor working parents who are trying to learn new things: try to learn two new things at once. 

- my general penchance for side projects
- love of cricket: let's build a cricket simulator
- initially just scoreboard /text but why not make a visual of the game
- can replay actual matches
- Wanting to learn rust for a while
- let's also learn how to write a game and use an ECS
- what's an ECS
- general idea
- why rust feels so nice for this
    - neat structs
    - cruel typing
    - borrow checker
