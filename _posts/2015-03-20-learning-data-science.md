Since finishing my PhD, I've been dividing my time between preparing three articles for publication in mathematics journals, and learning various data science techniques. It's been an enjoyable, challenging and rewarding experience that is currently culminating in a series of job interviews. This post is about the process of learning data science, from the unique perspective of someone with a PhD in pure mathematics. 

I never took computer science courses in my undergraduate degree, so my first step was to become a competent programmer. I chose Python as my language because it's something I've always been somewhat comfortable with. Already having a sound knowledge of the basics of Python programming, I spent some time on small personal projects. I wrote a series of Python scripts to automate searching for concert tickets on Gumtree.com.au; having an actual project that I had come up with work on was great, and I was very satisfied when I finished (even though the finished product still needs a lot of work). 

Early on I learnt the utility of git and wished I'd known about it while I was writing my PhD thesis (all my LaTeX code consists of thousands of commented out lines which are still in the files in the vague hope of one day being uncommented back to life). I also discovered Kaggle, which introduced me to the basic *greatest hits* machine learning algorithms. Although I did quite a few of the *for knowledge* Kaggle competitions, I never got particularly far with the ones with a money prize. 

Coursera was, as for most people doing what I'm doing, an invaluable resource. Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms courses were great for someone like me who has a very solid mathematical background but never took formal courses in algorithm design. There are a lot of courses in the Coursera *Data science specialisation* that were helpful; in particular my R programming was a little rusty and there were some courses that used R which I did. 

Most data science (who knows what that means anyway) jobs require knowledge of SQL. I am not the biggest fan of SQL but I learnt how to write queries using a bunch of online tutorials. I also found a great app that teaches you SQL queries using a dummy database of stars in the galaxy. 

Aside from these technical skills, most of which are still nascent for me and will be honed on the job, there was the less tangible requirement of me to change my mode of thinking. As a pure mathematician, you are trained as a purist, an aesthete. That there is only two possible outcomes for what you are doing: correct for eternity, or useless and irrefutably wrong. In all other disciplines there is some leeway. Your code is allowed to be sloppy, particularly if it does what it's designed to do, and even more so if what it's designed to do is just basic exploratory data analysis. You're also allowed to, and expected to, learn things on the go. This is subtly different to mathematics, where research builds on top of a complete understanding of existing knowledge.
