Since finishing my PhD, I've been dividing my time between preparing three articles for publication in mathematics journals, and learning various data science techniques. It's been an enjoyable, challenging and rewarding experience that is currently culminating in a series of job interviews. This post is about the process of learning data science.

I never took computer science courses in my undergraduate degree, so my first step was to become a competent programmer. I chose Python as my language because it's something I've always been somewhat comfortable with. Already having a sound knowledge of the basics of Python programming, I spent some time on small personal projects. I wrote a series of Python scripts to automate searching for concert tickets on Gumtree.com.au; having an actual project that I had come up with work on was great, and I was very satisfied when I finished (even though the finished product still needs a lot of work).
