As a fantastic bulwark against gerrymandering, and in a democratic statement that should be the envy of democracies worldwide, electoral districts in Australia are not fixed, but have boundaries which change according to shifting demographics as measured by census data. This makes precise comparisons between historical elections extremely difficult on a seat-by-seat basis, as many seats cease to exist between elections, or have become so distorted from their original boundaries that there is no meaning in comparing them.

Solution

Obtain historical election data, and extrapolate polling data to, polling place rather than just electoral district. Since it is always entire polling places that are reassigned to new or different districts, this will allow a more accurate calculation of the model on redistributed seats (Antony Green regularly performs the explicit calculation of "redoing" elections on new boundaries: a model would need to be built, preferably using demographic data from the census, to project opinion polling data onto polling places).

It should be clear that this would be an extremely lengthy and time-consuming process not without significant complications.
