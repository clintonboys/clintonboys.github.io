In August 2014, during my transition from studying mathematics in Sydney to working in tech in Tel Aviv, I deployed the first version of my personal website. The site looked pretty similar ten years ago to how it looks today, the main difference being that every post had a photograph at the top, of some different part of the world I had travelled to. These photos were quite nice, and a little differentiating feature from other bland text-based personal websites of tech folks, but at some point around five years ago, I decided to conform to the unwritten international bland text-based personal website standard, and removed the images, justifying it with my desire for a minimalist aesthetic, and improved loading times.
