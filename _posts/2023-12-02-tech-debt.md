Technical debt is a phrase that gets used a lot when building software and software companies. It refers to the process where deliberate decisions are made to build parts of a system with known flaws that are noted and will be addressed at some future point. There is a need to deliver a feature for some very good reason with a very hard deadline, and you can only make it if you compromise, do things manually, build something without thinking the design through fully. It happens all the time, especially in companies that grow quickly. 

But what happens when you make those changes, when you deliberately take on technical debt - as legitimate a decision as taking on monetary debt to finance a mortgage or any other venture - and *don't document it anywhere*?
