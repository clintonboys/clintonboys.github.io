*Notes on the Synthesis of Form* is a book written by architect and design theorist Christopher Alexander and originally published in 1964. It has become highly influential in a number of fields: mainly architecture, urban planning and computer science slash software engineering, for its highly original and powerful logical, even mathematical approach to design. 

I read the book recently and really enjoyed it. I felt like it gives words and a solid theory to a deeply intuitive idea: that designing or building something requires a very detailed and studied understanding of what you are designing or building it for. This simple idea almost sounds like a tautology, but it is remarkable how often it is abused, ignored or degraded. Below are a few notes and thoughts I had while reading the book, which I would really recommend to anyone interested in designing and building systems of any kind.
