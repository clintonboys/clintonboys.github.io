Plato said that the unobserved life is not worth living. Modern technology gives us an unprecedented range of ways to observe our lives, some of them familiar, many of them leading to uncomfortable and revealing truths. As a data scientist, I strongly believe in the power of data in understanding, analysis, problem-solving and decision-making, and thought that for my next project I would apply some of these principles to my own life.

The project has dual goals. The first is to generate a truly unique dataset which represents my actions over the course of a significant time period. This leads to interesting philosophical questions: for example can a person be uniquely identified by such a dataset? This dataset has aesthetic value and in my opinion artistic value, as a statement about the modern age and technology's hold on our lives. The second goal is to understand how the simple act of observation can lead to insights about oneself, and perhaps ultimately lead to an understanding of oneâ€™s shortcomings, and ways that one can be happier and more content. This will involve obtaining aggregated insights from my dataset, understanding them, and formulating from them
