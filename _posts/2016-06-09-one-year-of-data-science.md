I started work as a data scientist one year ago today. As I mentioned in the [first](http://www.clintonboys.com/five-months-of-data-science/) post I wrote on the topic, I get questions from time-to-time about the transition from academia to data science, and I hope these posts can help people get a better idea about the day-to-day life of someone working with data. 

**Projects from the last year**

I'll start with a short list of projects I've done in my job over the last year (not going into too much detail). Some of these are outside the traditional domain of a data scientist (I mentioned this in a [previous](http://www.clintonboys.com/writing-etls/) post) but I still enjoyed them and learnt a lot (and am starting to believe that the title of "data scientist" is a bit misleading anyway; see below).

- building a statistics model for user lifetime value
- writing a basic anomoly detector for website traffic (to detect successful content before its "hit peak")
- designing client-side event logic for a native monetisation platform
- writing an ETL pipeline for a new data product
- building a regression model to predict popular content
- using random forests to train a model for user engagement behaviour
- designing and helping write a content-based recommendations engine in Spark with Scala

**Skills that I've learnt**
