I have used Facebook for ten years and four months, and I'm stopping today. I remember when I first joined the platform; 
it was still pretty small, almost none of my friends were there, and the UI was hideous. I used it all throughout 
University, sharing photos and posts with my friends, checking in where I was, liking all sorts of celebrities and 
breakfast cereals and TV shows, and reading what everyone else was up to.

*An example of some quality content from back in the day.*

It was around 2010 when people started talking about “the Facebook algorithm”, as if it were some sentient creature, 
and it began to possess a real power over what we saw and interacted with every day. I no longer like the direction 
this algorithm is going in or its effects on society and on myself.

The Facebook platform today, with its main feature the News Feed, has evolved into something truly [dangerous](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/cambridge-analytica-and-a-moral-reckoning-in-silicon-valley), and [entirely unregulated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/opinion/facebook-regulation-incentive.html), that is having a measurable 
and proven effect on the ability of society to conduct discourse and argument in a meaningful way which is largely negative. I don’t 
know how much of the current state of the world can be blamed on Facebook, but I am certain that its echo chambers and 
inability to separate fact from opinion is part of the problem. Even worse, the company seems to be aware of the 
 problems it is facing but either unwilling or unable to take action to mitigate the damage. 

There are lots of great things about Facebook which I will miss, in particular the small niche groups which have 
replaced web forums as a genuine meeting place for people with questions looking for answers or for people going through 
the same experience as them. And I’m sure I’ll miss the presence in my life of some people who will not be prepared 
to keep in touch through other platforms. 

I love the internet and believe it has real power to create social change for the better. And I think social 
networks and platforms are not going away, and they need to be part of the internet and of a modern technological 
society. But I don’t need all the photos of me as a drunk 20-year-old to be part of that, and I don’t need to 
expose an extremely precise profile of my personality to advertisers to make that happen. 

I do want to try and build a more meaningful presence on the independent web, using this site. Here from time to time 
I will post my thoughts about things that interest me: data and mathematics, technology, music, travel and photography. 
  I hope that the time I'm not spending on Facebook will allow me to create a more meaningful and creative repository 
   here.
