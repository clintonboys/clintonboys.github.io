The below graph of the ALP and Coalition two-party preferred vote from the 2013 election until the eve of the 2016 election contains a massive amount of information and gives many insights about Australian politics and the electoral cycle.

I want to make a few comments about some features on this graph and then talk about the opinion polls in general and how they related to the actual result in a series of posts. 

**Honeymoon period**
The "honeymoon period" of a new leader is a phrase that gets a lot of airtime in Australian politics, and this cycle provided an opportunity to witness the full honeymoon between Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the Australian people, which began in September 2015 when he replaced Tony Abbott as leader of the parliamentary Liberal party, and ended in around April when opinion polls began to show the two parties' TPP support in a statistical tie, where it remained until election day. 

The interesting question is whether this is a feature of Australian politics in general, or whether this particularly dramatic course was peculiar to Turnbull. 

This century, there have been eleven changes of leadership in the two major parties.
