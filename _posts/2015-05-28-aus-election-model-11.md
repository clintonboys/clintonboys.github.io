In this post I want to look at the most difficult seats from the 2013 election for my basic model: those eleven seats whose final two candidates in the runoff process were *not* the ALP and the Coalition (more technically: their two-candidate preferred result was not a two-party-preferred result). Below is a list of these seats, the top two parties, and in brackets the party which placed third.

    Fairfax     (PUP v LNP) (ALP 3)
    Indi        (IND v LIB) (ALP 3)
    Kennedy     (KAP v LNP) (ALP 3)
    Melbourne   (GRN v ALP) (LIB 3)
    Denison     (IND v ALP) (LIB 3)

    Wills       (ALP v GRN) (LIB 2)
    Batman      (ALP v GRN) (LIB 3)
    New England (NAT v IND) (ALP 3)

    Mallee      (NAT v LIB) (ALP 3)
    Durack      (LIB v NAT) (ALP 3)
    Oâ€™Connor    (LIB v NAT) (ALP 3)
