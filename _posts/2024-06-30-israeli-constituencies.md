This project tries to simulate what the latest Israeli election would have been like under a single-member electorate system. Since we must preserve the "first-past-the-post" element, we end up with a system very similar to the system that chooses the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; since we want to retain the current size of the Knesset, we assume 120 constituencies, which we explicitly create on the map using data from the Knesset and census websites.
