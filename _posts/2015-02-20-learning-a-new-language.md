I'm moving overseas to Israel in less than three weeks to a country where I don't speak the language. I'm lucky enough to be moving with a partner who does speak my language, and into a family and community which is largely fluent in English. But when I was there for three months last year, the immersion in Hebrew was a fascinating process that I thought I'd write a little about.

Learning a language purely by immersion, without any real formal study or teaching, gives you a chance to feel your brain working. You can feel yourself remembering words you used to forget, making strings of sounds you used to find difficult, speaking faster and better all the time. Words that used to sound like nothing more than gibberish now have meaning: you stop translating everything to English in your head and start responding intuitively, instinctually.
