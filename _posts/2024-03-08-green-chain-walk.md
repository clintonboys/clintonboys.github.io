For many years now I have been reading [Craig Mod](https://www.craigmod.com/)'s writings about his many long, mostly solo, walks throughout Japan, where he has lived for many years. I find the writing inspiring, the photos beautiful, and have long been a walker myself, who these days doesn't get as much of a chance to walk.

This winter I managed to find a whole day to myself, a beautiful brisk London winter day, and I used it to walk 40km of the [Green Chain Walk](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/walking/green-chain-walk), from Nunhead in south London, a few miles from my house and home to a beautiful old [cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunhead_Cemetery), to the [Thames Barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier).  

I really enjoyed the way this walk had been put together. It essentially connects together all the large green public spaces in southeast London, with nicely signposted routes and emphasis on spending as much time as possible somewhere green.
