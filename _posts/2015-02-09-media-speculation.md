There's been a lot of discussion lately about the media's role in the leadership problems which have become a common feature of the Australian political landscape in recent years. I wanted to try and quantify media speculation in some (probably fairly crude) way and try and get a nice visualisation of the build-up and release cycle that accompanies these events.
