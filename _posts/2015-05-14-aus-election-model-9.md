I've spent the last few months of my spare time writing code for a [model](http://www.clintonboys.com/emma-chisit/) to forecast Australian elections. A very basic first version of the model is finished, and I wanted to write up a few things about how it works, mainly so I can explain the current shortcomings, and the improvements I want to make down the line.
