It is worthwhile noting that FiveThirtyEight does **not** attempt to forecast US congressional elections on a district-by-district basis (instead providing a probabilistic model for the Congressional makeup as a whole). This however is the sort of analysis one would expect in Australian elections to provide an analog to Silver's presidential forecasts. Except on an occasional, one-off basis, individual seats are **never** polled in Australia, so seat-by-seat data is non-existent (and when it is available, is too sporadic to be worthwhile).

The most robust and accurate opinion polling is conducted on a **countrywide** basis; often these countrywide results are broken down into states, but never into electoral districts. There should be a way to use clustering and nearest-neighbour analysis to obtain extrapolated polling estimates for individual districts.
