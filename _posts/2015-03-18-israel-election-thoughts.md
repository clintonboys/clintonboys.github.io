I've been in Israel for a week and yesterday I had the very interesting experience of observing elections in this country. I thought I'd write a bit about how I felt the process differed from elections in Australia. The first few things below are to give people a feel for how the system works; after that I'll give some of my personal opinions on the process and its (many) shortcomings. 

## The Israeli electoral system

Before I go into anything I should describe how the electoral system works here for people who have no clue. Israel is a unicameral (only one house: no Senate equivalent) parliamentary democracy which uses the closed-list method (there are political parties, these parties choose the order in which their members will be elected: kind of like the Australian Senate system) of party-list proportional representation, assigning seats in their 120-member legislative chamber (the Knesset) according to the d'Hondt method with a single at-large constituency (there are no seats, the whole country is treated as a single seat). The electoral threshhold is 3.25%, meaning parties must poll above this percentage of the vote to receive any seats whatsoever. Since 120 x 0.0325 = 3.9, it is impossible for a party to have 1, 2 or 3 seats in the Knesset: either a party polls less than the threshold and receives zero seats, or they poll above it and receive four or more. 

Israel has universal suffrage for **citizens** over eighteen (there are around 9 million people in Israel so about 5.5 million eligible voters). This includes the 20% of the country of Arab descent. None of the 4 million people in the occupied territories are allowed to vote. Israeli citizens who are overseas on election day can also not vote. 

The most important thing to realise about the system here is that it has *never resulted in a majority government*. Australians had no idea what to do in 2010 when we had a hung parliament: here there has never been anything else. This leads to pretty unstable governments which have to be patched together with parties that don't really like each other much. 

## Polling before the election

The nature of the electoral system here makes polling very difficult and notoriously unreliable. I think the biggest factor in the unreliability is the high electoral threshhold: this completely destroys the linearity of models when parties polling near the threshhold are included. I had a go at aggregating all the available opinion polls from the thirty days before the final polls were released [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/israel-poll-aggregator-1/). There's a four-day embargo on polls before the election. My model didn't do very well (and neither did the polls that it aggregated). 

## Political parties

The Israeli political landscape is dominated by the nationalist right. I'll give a brief summary of the ten main parties 

- Meretz
- Nationalism in Israel
- Benjamin 
- Naftali Bennett
