I've been in Israel for a week and yesterday I had the very interesting experience of observing elections in this country. I thought I'd write a bit about how I felt the process differed from elections in Australia. The first few things below are to give people a feel for how the system works; after that I'll give some of my personal opinions on the process and its (many) shortcomings. 

## The Israeli electoral system

Before I go into anything I should describe how the electoral system works here for people who have no clue. Israel is a unicameral (only one house: no Senate equivalent) parliamentary democracy which uses the closed-list method (there are political parties, these parties choose the order in which their members will be elected: kind of like the Australian Senate system) of party-list proportional representation, assigning seats in their 120-member legislative chamber (the Knesset) according to the d'Hondt method with a single at-large constituency (there are no seats, the whole country is treated as a single seat). The electoral threshhold is 3.25%, meaning parties must poll above this percentage of the vote to receive any seats whatsoever. Since 120 x 0.0325 = 3.9, it is impossible for a party to have 1, 2 or 3 seats in the Knesset: either a party polls less than the threshold and receives zero seats, or they poll above it and receive four or more. 

Israel has universal suffrage for **citizens** over eighteen (there are around 9 million people in Israel so about 5.5 million eligible voters). This includes the 20% of the country of Arab descent. None of the 4 million people in the occupied territories are allowed to vote. Israeli citizens who are overseas on election day can also not vote. 

The most important thing to realise about the system here is that it has *never resulted in a majority government*. Australians had no idea what to do in 2010 when we had a hung parliament: here there has never been anything else. This leads to pretty unstable governments which have to be patched together with parties that don't really like each other much. 

## Polling before the election

The nature of the electoral system here makes polling very difficult and notoriously unreliable. I think the biggest factor in the unreliability is the high electoral threshhold: this completely destroys the linearity of models when parties polling near the threshhold are included. I had a go at aggregating all the available opinion polls from the thirty days before the final polls were released [here](http://www.clintonboys.com/israel-poll-aggregator-1/). There's a four-day embargo on polls before the election. My model didn't do very well (and neither did the polls that it aggregated). 

## Political parties

The Israeli political landscape is dominated by the nationalist right. I'll give a brief summary of the ten main parties.

### Likud

The ruling party in the current right-wing coalition, headed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ("Bibi"). He called these early elections last year after the breakdown of his coalition due to infighting with ministers. Most parties ran on a platform of personal attacks against the PM, whose popularity seemed to me to be very low, wracked by various scandals and grandstanding himself in front of the US Congress talking about the threat of Iranian nuclear weapons when most people here are more worried about the rising cost of living. Netanyahu is sometimes known as The Magician for his ability to win from seemingly unwinnable positions (as happened again this time), and to convince people he is worth voting for despite having accomplished almost nothing at all. 

### Zionist Camp

A merger of the center-left Labor and Hatnuah parties, co-led by Labor leader Isaac Herzog  ("Bougie") and Hatnuah leader Tzipi Livni. Herzog has been a perennial also-ran but invested a lot of effort in improving his image, even undergoing voice training to improve his girly tones. Livni was once chief negotiator with the Palestinians and has a bit of a bossy image. 

### Joint List

Faced with constant discrimination and low standards of living compared to Jews, most Arab Israelis feel they have little choice than to vote for an Arab interest party, or not to vote at all. This year the Arab parties all joined together with the hope of for the first time becoming a formidable political force. The Joint List, headed by Ayman Oudeh who represents the centrist Hadash party, comprises Arab parties running the gamut from Marxist to Palestianian nationalist to Islamist. 

### Yesh Atid

Easy-on-the-eye Yair Lapid, former finance minister, was kicked out of government by Bibi, precipitating these elections. His centrist party runs on a socio-economic platform. 

### Kulanu

Former Likud member Moshe Kahlon split to form his own centre-right party, also largely focussed on the economy. Kahlon is a popular figure; at the mention of his name most people are quick to recall the work he did to improve Israel's mobile phone networks. 

### The Jewish Home

This party is headed by far-right Jewish nationalist bigot Naftali Bennett, whose "Israel Stability Initiative" advocates the annexation of the West Bank and the institution of many of the hallmarks of an apartheid state. Bennett espouses a popular new brand of seemingly pragmatic, no-nonsense, racist anti-Arab sentiment. The official line of his party is that the entire land of Israel, from the river to the sea, was given to the Jewish people by God. He is known for his savvy use of social media and is infamous for his prideful claim to have "killed lots of Arabs in [his] life, and there is absolutely no problem with that". 

### Shas

One of the two main religious parties, serving the Sephardic Orthodox community. Smaller this year because one of its members split to form his own party which ended up polling below the threshhold. All sorts of ridiculous nonsense from these guys: they were handing out flyers on election day claiming voting for them was your key to heaven. They are based on some strange personality cult sect of Judaism related to a recently deceased rabbi. The head of this party, Aryeh Deri, served 22 months in prison for accepting bribes. Has referred to homosexuality as "a plague as toxic as bird flu". 

### United Torah Judaism

The other religious right party, slightly (but not much) less retarded than Shas, serving the Ashkenazi Orthodox community. Both parties refuse to allow women to run as Knesset members. Their policies are determined by a council of senior rabbis. 

### Yisrael Beitanu

Another right-wing nationalist party headed by former foreign minister Avigdor Liebermann. Most of the party's base are Russian Jewish immigrants. Entirely contemptible racist who said during the campaign that Arab citizens who speak out against the State of Israel should have their heads removed with an ax. 

### Meretz

The left-wing, pro-Palestinian rights, pro-gay rights, pro-marriage equality (currently Jews cannot marry non-Jews in Israel) social democratic party. Was hovering very close to the electoral threshold in many polls. 

## Lead-up to the election

The whole process was a big eye-opener for me about the country as a whole. The people I talk to and interact with are mostly politically similar to me, so I was a little taken aback when I saw the degree to which politicians were able to go on television or the radio, say openly racist things, and get away with it. These are the kind of things that, if an Australian politician was caught muttering them off-camera his political career would be over. 

### Contempt for the Arab community

Israel is a deeply segregated and racist country where Arab citizens are treated largely as second-class citizens, whose voting rights are a hassle that only serve to distract the Jewish majority from being able to elect the government they want.
