I spent a few days this week learning about Scalding. This is Twitter's in-house MapReduce framework, written in Scala, that has access to Twitter's API and hence can search through the entire tweet corpus. Scala is a language I've had almost no experience with, so this was a great opportunity for me to get a feel for the basic syntax, as well as come up with a couple of interesting problems that can be solved quickly and easily with Scalding.
